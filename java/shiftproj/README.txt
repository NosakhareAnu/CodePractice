Staff Shift Management System

Overview:
The Staff Shift Management System is a Java-based desktop application designed to streamline and automate the process of assigning, tracking, and managing staff shifts within an organization. It provides role-based access, allowing admins to create shifts, assign them to staff, and generate shift reports, while staff can view their scheduled shifts and update availability.
